Null
Notice that NULLs are different than a zero - they are cells where data does not exist.
When identifying NULLs in a WHERE clause, we write IS NULL or IS NOT NULL. 
We don't use =, because NULL isn't considered a value in SQL. Rather, it is a property of the data.

NULLs - Expert Tip
There are two common ways in which you are likely to encounter NULLs:

- NULLs frequently occur when performing a LEFT or RIGHT JOIN. 
  You saw in the last lesson - when some rows in the left table of a left join are not matched with rows in the right table, 
  those rows will contain some NULL values in the result set.

- NULLs can also occur from simply missing data in our database.

===============================================================================================================
COUNT
Notice that COUNT does not consider rows that have NULL values. 
Therefore, this can be useful for quickly identifying which rows have missing data. 
You will learn GROUP BY in an upcoming concept, and then each of these aggregators will become much more useful.

========================================================================================================
SUM
Unlike COUNT, you can only use SUM on numeric columns.
However, SUM will ignore NULL values, as do the other aggregation functions you will see in the upcoming lessons.

Aggregation Reminder
An important thing to remember: aggregators only aggregate vertically - the values of a column. 
If you want to perform a calculation across rows, you would do this with simple arithmetic.

We saw this in the first lesson if you need a refresher, 
but the quiz in the next concept should assure you still remember how to aggregate across rows.
