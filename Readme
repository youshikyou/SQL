DATA AGGREGATION:
NULL / ORDER BY / MAX / MIN / SUM / AVG / GROUP BY / HAVING / COUNT/ DISTINCT
DATE_TRUNC
DATE_PART
CASE WHEN THEN ELSE END AS


SUBQUERY: 
记得可以用1，2等数字来代替 
SELECT order_id, total_spending  FROM xxx ORDER BY 1
WITH table AS


DATA CLEANING:
LEFT,RIGHT,SUBTRING(text,begin,length),LENGTH,STRPOS(text,arg) / POSITION(arg IN text)
CONCAT 与 ||相同
CAST 与 :: 相同，定义数据类型
COALESCE() 补全空白值


WINDOW FUNCTION:
OVER,ALIASE,LAG/LEAD,NTILE,RANK(),DENSE_RANK(),ROW_NUMBER(),PARTITION BY

LIMIT cannot speed up when there is an aggregation.
