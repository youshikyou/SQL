1.List the teachers who have NULL for their department.
Why we cannot use =
You might think that the phrase dept=NULL would work here but it doesn't - you can use the phrase dept IS NULL

SELECT name
FROM teacher
WHERE dept IS NULL

2.Note the INNER JOIN misses the teachers with no department and the departments with no teacher.
SELECT teacher.name, dept.name
 FROM teacher INNER JOIN dept
           ON (teacher.dept=dept.id)

3.Use a different JOIN so that all teachers are listed.
SELECT teacher.name,dept.name
FROM teacher LEFT JOIN dept ON dept.id=teacher.dept
