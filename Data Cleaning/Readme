LEFT pulls a specified number of characters for each row in a specified column starting at the beginning (or from the left). 
As you saw here, you can pull the first three digits of a phone number using LEFT(phone_number, 3).

RIGHT pulls a specified number of characters for each row in a specified column starting at the end (or from the right). 
As you saw here, you can pull the last eight digits of a phone number using RIGHT(phone_number, 8).

LENGTH provides the number of characters for each row of a specified column.
Here, you saw that we could use this to get the length of each phone number as LENGTH(phone_number).

==============================================================================
POSITION takes a character and a column, and provides the index where that character is for each row. 
The index of the first position is 1 in SQL. If you come from another programming language, many begin indexing at 0. 
Here, you saw that you can pull the index of a comma as POSITION(',' IN city_state).


STRPOS provides the same result as POSITION, but the syntax for achieving those results
is a bit different as shown here: STRPOS(city_state, ',').


Note, both POSITION and STRPOS are case sensitive, so looking for A is different than looking for a.


Therefore, if you want to pull an index regardless of the case of a letter, 
you might want to use LOWER or UPPER to make all of the characters lower or uppercase.
